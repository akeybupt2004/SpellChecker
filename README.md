SpellChecker
============

SpellChecker is a lightweight .NET library that checks spelling errors in any human language (dictionaries for English and Russian languages are provided for now).
It considers word parts (such as suffixes and prefixes) during the spell check.
The library also suggests correction options for misspelled words analyzing the following cases:
- merged words (missed space character)
- missed character in a word
- replaced character
- extra character
- swapped neighbor characters
